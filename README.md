# üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
Hello! I am a Software and Systems Engineer with a keen interest in Electronic and Computer Engineering. I served as the founder of the Google Developer Student Club between 2021 and 2022.

My expertise lies in designing software solutions that amalgamate the worlds of electronic and computer engineering, crafting engineering marvels. The challenge of merging cutting-edge technology with user-centered design to create innovative systems motivates me.

I derive immense pleasure from continual learning and exploring new horizons in software development. I am particularly excited about honing my skills in software architecture and system design.

During my spare time, I explore the latest advancements in technology, brainstorm new project ideas, or mentor developers within the tech community.

Let's explore the vast horizons of technology together!

üî≠ Currently working on: Backend-focused full-stack web development.
ü§ù Interested in collaborating on: Open-source ML projects and tech community initiatives.
üÜò Need help with: Optimizing database interactions and enhancing data processing algorithms.
üìö Learning about: Advanced AI concepts, especially neural networks and NLP.
‚ùì You can ask me about: Full-stack development, project management, or code deployment strategies.
üéâ Fun fact: I developed an AI chatbot that recites poetry in a 24-hour hackathon!
