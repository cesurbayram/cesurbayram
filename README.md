# üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
Hello there! I'm a Software and Systems Engineer passionate about Electronics & Computer Engineering. I've had the privilege of leading as the Founder of the Google Developer Student Club at GTU from 2021 to 2022.

My expertise lies in crafting and engineering software solutions that merge the worlds of electronics and computing. I am driven by the challenge of creating innovative systems that blend cutting-edge technology with user-centric design.

I thrive on continuous learning and exploring new frontiers in software development. I'm particularly enthusiastic about refining my skills in software architecture and system design to build robust and scalable solutions.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest developments in technology, brainstorming new project ideas, or mentoring aspiring developers in the tech community.

Let's connect and explore the vast horizons of technology together!

 üî≠ Currently working on: Backend-focused full-stack web development.
 ü§ù Looking to collaborate on: Open-source ML projects and tech community initiatives.
 üÜò Need help with: Optimizing database interactions and refining data processing algorithms.
 üìö Learning: Advanced AI concepts, especially neural networks and NLP.
